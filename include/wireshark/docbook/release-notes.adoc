== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

__We do not ship official 32-bit Windows packages for Wireshark 4.0 and later__.
If you need to use Wireshark on that platform, we recommend using the latest 3.6 release.
wsbuglink:17779[]

// * The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.2.
// They previously shipped with Qt 6.2.3.

If you’re running Wireshark on macOS and upgraded to macOS 13 from an earlier version, you might have to open and run the “Uninstall ChmodBPF” package, then open and run “Install ChmodBPF” in order to reset the ChmodBPF Launch Daemon.
